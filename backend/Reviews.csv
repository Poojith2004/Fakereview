Love these ear buds. Easy to pair and great sound quality.,64,20,58,142
"Comfortable fit, good sound, handy charge case",63,20,55,139
Very comfy. Sounds is great. Definitely would buy again.,75,20,58,153
Terrible. Do not buy. Unless you’re good with a buying one every month. These lasted all of 32 days. Exactly 32 days. The day they just up and died was the day after the final day to return them.The “long battery life” is also a joke. They last almost as long as any other headphone. For me that meant wearing them about 2 hrs each morning for my workouts and needing to recharge them once a week.,72,20,41,133
Mal sonidoSe ve muy ordinario.,86,20,39,145
"Comes with a case, cord, and three sizes of earbud tips. I found for my particular ear I needed the larger tips to get the best sound. It’s not just a matter of comfort, but if the air tip can seal up the air canal better you will get much better base sound.I did a test for two days and ran the earbuds continuously and both days ran for 11 hours. Not the 15 as advertised nor the 13 they mention in the little manual. But 11 hours is pretty good! this was just in my first few days of use. Hopefully the playtime will not degrade.I really like the earbuds with the over ear support because I’m less likely to have them fall out and also if my ears get a little tired from the earbuds being in there, I can always just pop the earbud out, but leave them hanging on my ear, also so I can talk with people. I like the three buttons on there. I’ve seen earbuds with just one button and I’m sure that it’s easy to use, but I like the separate buttons for the separate functions. There is a button for increasing the volume and advancing to the next song, another button for decreasing the volume and going back to the beginning of a song and then there’s a function button on the back end that pauses music. Of course there’s other functions too, but I haven’t gotten into that and have not received any phone calls yet so I can’t attest to how well those work but I would imagine I just hit the function button, which is right on the back.I wanted to get earbuds that had long playtime because I didn’t wanna just pick up my earbuds and then have them die after just a few minutes of listening to music. Also, sometimes when I’m out in the yard, I’ll be out there for more than a couple hours, so I need something that will last. Also, when you’re on a long plane trip, these will be very useful as well so you could plug in your phone to let it charge and then use these earbuds Via Bluetooth.Overall, pretty happy with these.",15,20,57,93
"These headphones were on my wish list, I loved them from the moment I saw them, they have a very original color, a metallic pink, they fit very well, and they don't fall out easily, they come with all their accessories and of course their instruction guide so you know how to connect them to your phone, although this isn't very necessary because for me it was very easy to connect them, no complications at all, it comes in a very nice and simple box! I would definitely buy them again.",35,20,58,114
Worked great for 1 month.  But 3 days past the 30 day return window the left ear bud stopped charging.  Once it was dead there was nothing I could do to reset it or get it to charge.  I thought it was charging but now I know it wasn't.  The light blinked and everything seemed OK.  But it's now worthless.  A total waste of money.  DO NOT BUY.,59,20,43,123
Very good,87,20,32,139
"I rarely write a review, but the return date was 4/16, here we are on 4/21 and the sound quality has just been getting worse each day we use them.  We ordered two sets and they are both starting to fail. The sound quality is awful now, doesn't even sound like the artist singing or the person talking.  Very disappointed and nothing we can do about it now.  I do not recommend purchasing.",53,20,37,111
"One month and four days after receiving these ear buds, the right channel apparently ran out of battery power and refused to charge.  I contacted the seller and was told since Amazon shipped them, it was out of their hands.I understand, early failures of electronics is a fact of life, and so long as the manufacturer backs up the product, I'm good; but seriously, 35 days, and ""Sorry, not our problem""?",67,20,48,135
For some reason they don't charge post 82%. Super disappointing.,86,20,33,140
Good fit poor bass quality to me.,86,20,58,165
The case is big and bulky. I couldn’t get them to connect to my IPad. I tried everything and spent too much time trying.,79,20,41,141
"I'm not going to say these are the best ear buds ever, but I was very surprised at the quality. I tend to lose ear buds and this is my second pair that I bought if that says anything.",70,0,55,126
These work great and the battery lasts a long time,74,20,60,155
I don't trust the product information nor reviews of this item. No way these are $200 earphones; there isn't even the name of the brand on the box. There are barely any instructions and I found it very difficult to get them to pair and use. Sound quality is bad. Do not buy.,60,20,31,111
Son perfectos me gusta escuchar música y esto es perfecto para mi,83,20,37,140
"These are fantastic!  They sound great, they’re comfortable, they hold a charge very well!  The LED charge level on the case is a great bonus!  These are five times better than those JLabs I had which were junk.",54,20,50,125
"Clear sound, strong bass, easy pairing. Super comfortable fit and long battery life—perfect for workouts or everyday use. Highly recommend!",69,20,60,150
These are great I just don’t like that there’s not a button to actually answer calls but it does what is expected,81,20,53,154
"I haven’t heard music this clear or in depth in years, I wear hearing aids and when I tried them on I was stunned on the clarity and tones.  Well worth the purchase!",46,20,51,117
"Glad my other ones stopped working.  The controls are easy to use, no more trying to do double taps.  You either press once for volume or press and hold to skip, and both sides do the same thing.  After switching to the small earbuds they stayed in while running.  It is a more compact design that fits over the top of an ear not all the way around.  Battery lasts a long time.",67,20,52,139
"I love my new earbuds! I'm impressed with how comfortable these are and how securely they stay in place during my active day. The sound is crisp, clear and balanced. The bluetooth works seamlessly with my phone and has better range than any other earbuds I have tried.",48,20,61,129
Yo voy al gimnasio y estos me los ordene para ello ya q no se te caen ya no me preoco por q se me caigan ta q se aguantan muy bien a la oreja son muy profesionales,66,20,39,126

    Besides being easy to use when working out I must say the battery life is incredible you can listen music for hours at a time and the battery won’t die also the noise cancellation feature works perfectly definitely worths the money",56,0,23,79
OMG these earplugs are the best in the world world they really work extremely good,67,20,46,133
Audífonos muy cómodos de usar se escuchan muy bien son muy útiles,85,0,39,125
"I love these headphones, they sound good, the battery lasts a long time and best of all, they are very well priced. !!!",55,20,60,135
Good headphones. Better for listening to podcasts or audiobooks vs music!,74,20,41,135
Good fit and lightweight. Definitely work for the price!,62,20,58,141
They arrived on time and they were exactly what I ordered. They fit well and look nice. However the sound isn't great at all. Based on other reviews I read I choose these because of the great price and supposed sound quality. Many reviews said they had great bass and that's not true at all. Infact everything sounds very monotoned. I listened to several types of music and podcasts and they all sound the same. Debating on returning them or just getting a different brand and keep these as a backup.,59,20,66,145
This product was around $25. There was a promotion price from original $200. I bought based of that and rating. This is definitely not $200. Its definitely not $25. The microphone doesnt work when your on a call. The other person cant hear my voice clearly. Don't trust the lie,62,20,44,127
Auriculares de buena calidad he comprado varios pero este me ha gustado mas le dura mucho su carga no te molesta en tu oido se escuchan nitidos,91,20,37,149
"Didn't fit well, so it sounded very thin. Wouldn't recommend! Oh, well lost out on $25 dollars.",67,20,32,120
Exceptionally clear sound quality. Very functional and easy to fit my ear canals. Very durable and beautiful rose gold color,67,20,58,146
"These are great for the price, I mean what do you expect for under $25? I love how they fit and stay on my ears, I have to have an ear hook otherwise they just fall out. So far, no pinching or uncomfortable headaches like others in the past. I love how long they last and how the case can recharge them for extra life. Yeah, the sound isn't the greatest, but again...you get what you pay for. I mostly only listen to podcasts and not music anyway, so these are great for me!",35,20,63,119
"These wireless earbuds have truly elevated my listening experience! The sound quality is crisp and clear, with a rich bass that makes my favorite music come alive. The Bluetooth connection is seamless and reliable, and I've experienced no dropouts or interruptions.The battery life is phenomenal; I can easily get through a full day of use, and the charging case provides plenty of extra power.The earbuds are also incredibly comfortable and secure, even during intense workouts. The noise-canceling microphone works surprisingly well, making calls clear and easy, even in noisy environments. The digital power display on the case is a very useful feature, letting me know exactly how much charge I have left.",34,20,63,118
These earbuds last a really long time and have great sound for the price,75,20,68,164
"They really exceed expectations. The battery lasts a very long time, the sound is clear with good bass, and the microphone delivers crisp call quality. The charging display is a great added touch. Comfortable, practical, and excellent value for money. Highly recommended.",63,20,65,149

They fit securely in my ears, so I don’t have to worry about them falling out while I’m on the move.

    Great quality sound and noise Cancelling features make these earbuds perfect for gym workouts. Sleek design and fantastic value for money!",56,0,24,81
"I love the sound for calls and listening to music. I, however,  need an accessory that will not need my always carrying around the phone on my small house.  The sound quality is not good when used with an iPad.  Besides,  it would be quite convenient to have the callers announced.The fit,  however,  is quite good.",66,20,61,147
Good Sounds and quality,86,20,44,151
Great earbuds for someone who is active. I got these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They fit snug around his ear so he is able to wear them while he is working and not have to worry about them falling out. The audio is clear and it also has good bass and is loud. They stay charged for a long period of time and it doesn't take long for them to charge as well. They seem to be very durable as well. Definitely worth the money spent on them plus more.,51,0,60,112
Muy buena calidad y el precio super accessible,74,20,53,147
"Excellent quality, accurate sound quality, charges very quickly, and holds a charge for several hours. Easy to carry, practical. My brother loved it.",67,20,52,139
"These headphones are great quality. The sound quality is amazing, I love how it shows the charge percentage on the case, these would be a great gift for birthdays, holidays, etc.",62,20,52,135
"My sister asked me for these headphones as a gift. The packaging is secure and very strong. She loves marathons and has to train a lot. The battery lasts a long time, so she doesn't have to worry about carrying other headphones. Plus, they're sweat-resistant. I love them.🥰",55,20,57,133
Sound amazing great product,64,20,45,129
"I really enjoyed these earbuds at first—the sound quality is excellent, and they stay securely in place during workouts, even high-intensity sessions with lots of jumping and movements like downward dog in yoga. However, I’m giving them three stars because the right earbud stopped working after just 2–3 weeks of use.I’ve only used them for workouts and have been careful to follow the care instructions, including wiping them dry before placing them back in the case. It’s frustrating and disappointing to have them fail so quickly despite taking proper care. I expected better durability for workout earbuds.",51,20,51,123
"Amazing sound quality for the price, comfort could be slightly better but worth it 100%.",76,20,52,149
"The sound quality is good. I mean, not sublime like you'd hope for for the amount they cost BUUUUT the battery life is f-ing wild. I've yet to listen to them til they're dead and I work 12 hour shifts. Charge holds for a long long time, sound is good, battery life is phenomenal. And I got them on a great sale. Very impressive all together.",51,20,67,138
I got these for the kids for their iPads and it’s had the longest lasting battery ever! Better than my brand name headphones! Totally worth it!,68,20,54,142
"These earbuds are absolutely fantastic! The sound quality is clear with deep bass, and the noise canceling works surprisingly well, especially during workouts or when I need to focus. They fit securely thanks to the ear hook design and stay in place even during intense movement. The battery life is incredible, I’ve gone several days without charging and the LED power display on the case is super convenient. The Bluetooth connection is quick and stable, making these an unbeatable value for the price. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase!",46,20,64,130
Absolutely love these. Easy to pair. Hold a charge well. Great sound and the case is convenient. Would definitely buy again.,72,20,59,152
These wireless earbuds deliver exceptional sound with deep bass and crisp clarity. The 80-hour playback and LED power display are incredibly convenient. Comfortable and secure fit makes them perfect for workouts and running. The noise-canceling mic ensures clear calls. Great value for the price—highly recommended for active lifestyles.,63,20,58,141
Love these earbuds good quality charge really fast and great price,64,20,61,146
"I had in-ear buds that would fall out when I ran (especially once I started sweating), so I got some over-ear ones, but after less than 6 months one of them died so I needed something new. These had good reviews and are a good price, so I decided to give them a try. So far, I'm quite happy with them. Easy to pair by bluetooth, and I have paired them with 2 different devices to date. The sounds quality is pretty good. They hold a charge well, so far, and seem to last quite a long time. The case gives you % charged, which is nice. I can't say anything about charging speed since they came charged and are still >50% (and I've had them for 2 weeks)!  Sometimes it takes me a minute to get them in, but maybe I'm just not very coordinated! (The in-ear part is angled so you need to orient it just right) They did come with different size rubber in-ear covers (I don't know what to call them?) so maybe I need to try smaller ones and they'd be easier to get in. They definitely diminish external noise. The ear hooks keep them solidly in place, even if I hang upside down.",15,20,61,96
"Volume is low when receiving a call or listening to someone during a call. Return window has closed, wouldn't recommend",88,20,34,143
They have worked great so far.,74,20,48,142
Bought this for traveling.  Didn’t want to hassle with cords while the plane.  Had a little difficulty syncing to my iPhone.  Tried 3 times and it synced.  Sound is good and could not hear the noise around me.  Would recommend this to anyone!,73,20,55,148
They look good and fit great.,64,20,46,130
I already use it but after 5hour the power down to 10% not over 15hour like you say to amazon store,87,20,31,138
"I bought these headphones, they are nice and very good. They connect with Bluetooth, they extend the charge, they are very good, I recommend them 100%.",55,0,38,94
"I'd give them a five if the sound quality were a little better, but I really love the battery life, so the pros outweigh the cons.Really good deal.",57,20,63,140
I’m loving this one it’s really cute and handy,65,20,40,125
They are easy to connect to your phone they are really nice quality they charge quickly made from good material I’m obsessed with these!,65,20,63,149
"Best you will find in this price range, much preferred over the dozen other pairs I've tried over the years. Comfortable ear piece keeps them in place. Great sound, I bought another pair for my wife and she agrees",64,20,55,139
"I really like these,  totally satisfied.  They are very comfortable and the sound is great. I've had several pair, some were the more expensive brands. In all honesty these are probably as good and even better than most. The price is great , especially for the quality.  If you are looking for a good pair of earbuds without spending a few hundred dollars check these out.",55,20,67,142
"Muy bonitos y discretos, se ven de buena calidad, me gustan",82,20,39,141
I gave it to my best friend for his birthday and I love them they sound very good excellent for their price,59,20,41,121
These are absolutely perfect. Love how snug they fit around my ears. Super loud and clear clarity. No more straining to hear what someone is saying! Cancels background noises. Very easy to pair and get going,64,20,57,142
"This earbud sounds so good I really like it , the functionality is super , and it’s easy to connect with my phone , easy to set up .",59,20,57,137
"Very comfortable earpieces even after wearing them for hours while asleep. (That for me is the real test... When a pair of earbuds make it through the night without coming out, they get my vote) ... obviously combined with the sound quality. These get great bass response & a pretty wide audio field can be enjoyed. I'm very happy with my purchase so far.",54,20,60,135
"These headphones exceeded my expectations.The battery lasts a long time (they are really close to 80 hours) and the charging screen is very useful. The sound is clear, the noise-canceling microphone works very well on calls, and they fit perfectly for running or training. Plus, the black design looks great.",58,20,63,141
"Really great for the price. If they're in correctly, the bass is nice. Not as clear as my Bose and Sony, but darn close. I love these for the gym.",59,0,59,119
"I received these today. Pairing was almost immediate. Buttons are easy to understand and activate. Sound quality is very good provided you use the correct size ear piece. Connection to SIRI works great. Overall size is a bit larger than I’d like, but I need this over the ear design that stays put- and so far so good. If they hold up, for $25 USD it’s hard to go wrong.",66,20,61,147
"These are great earbuds. My son loves them! They fit very well and they stay in place, no matter what activity he is doing. He does a lot of spirts so them being sweat proof is a huge bonus!  They sound clear, no matter the volume he sets them at. They function just as they should. Setting them up was a breeze thanks to them being Bluetooth. They are durable, which is great because my son can be very hard on earbuds.  They have a great battery life. He isn’t having to constantly charge them. I would definitely buy them for him again.",41,20,62,124
"They work great. Clear sound, and you can be herd when you talk. Great ear buds",68,20,53,141
"La calidad del sonido es excelente, con un bajo potente y agudos nítidos.",87,0,37,124
"Excellent product, super comfortable with excellent audio quality and the battery lasts quite a bit",67,20,41,128
I was super excited to receive this ear piece and I must say I was a bit disappointed. They were very easy to set up and the Bluetooth connectivity was flawless.,56,20,57,134
Lightweight on the ears. Sounds is fine and can do with streaming music. Connection is stable,87,20,48,156
Easy to set up. Comfortable. Easy to connect Bluetooth. Sounds great.,63,0,52,116
Awesome headphones my daughter loves them!,63,20,19,103
I love these while doing yard work! It sounds great and blocks out noise while I’m in the zone! Very comfortable to Wear and they don’t fall out during movements. I still love and use my AirPods but these are just as good to me. I also use it for gaming!,39,20,43,102

    OK now let me tell you something these earbuds right here are very, very easy to set up. They have very high quality and the functionality on this device. Now what gets me more? It's the durability of the battery you get 80 hours of playback time off of one charge. It is easy to connect to Bluetooth and the sound quality 10 out of 10.",66,20,56,143
